\Section{conclude}{Conclusion}
We have presented a system for extracting open domain relation triples
  by breaking a long sentence into short, coherent clauses, and then
  finding the maximally simple relation triples which are warranted given
  each of these clauses.
This allows the system to have a greater awareness of the context of each
  extraction, and to provide informative triples to downstream applications.
We show that our approach performs well on one such downstream application:
  the KBP Slot Filling task.
