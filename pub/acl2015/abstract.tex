\begin{abstract}
Short relation triples produced by
  Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) systems are useful 
  for a number of NLP tasks.
%Traditionally, these are collected directly from surface patterns;
%  however, this encourages short dependency paths, 
%  and is prone to ignoring the larger context of the sentence.
%Rather than searching directly for surface patterns,
We propose casting OpenIE as the restricted entailment task of finding
  short entailed sentences from a longer utterance.
This allows us both to capture longer range dependencies,
  and allows the system to be sensitive to the larger context of the
  sentence.
%In our approach, 
We extract self-contained clauses from the original 
  sentence, and then run natural logic inference to further 
  shorten each clause.
These short fragments can themselves be useful, or simple rules
  can be applied to produce more conventional OpenIE triples.
We evaluate our approach on the 2013 TAC-KBP competition, showing
  an over 9000\% absolute F$_1$ gain over a submission using OpenIE 4.
