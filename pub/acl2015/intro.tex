\Section{intro}{Introduction}

% Motivation
Open information extraction (open IE) has been shown to be useful in a
  number of NLP tasks, such as question answering\needcite (UW
  work goes here),
  relation extraction\needcite (KBP submission; matrix factorization),
  and probably other things too\needcite.
In this paper, we address two problems with modern open IE systems:
  first, they either do not capture relations between mentions which
  are not canonically connected (e.g., subject verb object triples) or
  these long-range dependencies are captured using a large number of
  sparse rules.
We propose an alternate approach which learns a classifier over a
  simple set of actions to split long sentences into coherent
  independent clauses.

Second, existing systems generally do a poor job of producing
  canonical argument forms, either stripping relevant
  information, or retaining irrelevant information in the argument.
Both of these are harmuful for downstream applications using the
  output of the systems
We address this problem by extracting more specific (i.e., shorter)
  arguments only if they are logically warranted by the larger
  context of the sentence.
This allows us to extract the maximally specific arguments for each
  extracted triple.

      & $~\rightarrow$ (Jeremy; marry; Andrew) \\

      & $~\rightarrow$ (Chancelor Merkel; visit; China) \\
    4 & \w{Enemies give fake compliments} \\
      & $~\rightarrow$ (Enemies, give, fake complements) \\

% Challenge: many rules
Conventionally, open IE systems search a collection of patterns over either
  the surface form or dependency tree of the sentence.
For simple relations (e.g., subject verb object triples) a small set of
  patterns covers most sentences.
However, relevant relations are often expressed in more convoluted
  ways -- for instance, example 1 in \reffig{teaser}.
Systems like OLLIE \cite{key:2012mausam-ollie} approach this problem by 
  using a bootstrapping method to create a large corpus of broad-coverage
  partially lexicalized patterns.
Although this is effective at capturing many of these patterns,
  this level of lexicalization can lead to unintuitive behavior on 
  out-of-domain text.
For instance, while \ww{Obama is president} is extracted correctly by
  the system, \ww{cats are cute} is not.

We propose mitigating the problem by decomposing the extraction task into
  two sub-tasks:
  we first learn a classifier for splitting a sentence into shorter
  utterances, and then extract triples using a simple set of
  unlexicalized patterns over these short utterances.
Each split clause, in turn, can optionally borrow either the entire
  governing clause, or just the subject of the governing clause.
For example, the first sentence in \reffig{teaser} will produce the
  clause \ww{Obama born in Honolulu, Hawaii}, borrowing the subject
  \ww{Obama} from the governing clause.
This procedure allows us to capture a large variety of long range 
  dependencies, while keeping both the state space of the clause splitting
  classifier small, and keeping the set of hand-coded patterns unlexicalized
  and small.

% Challenge: granularity of arguments
A second key challenge for open IE systems is chosing the right level of
  granularity for the triples being expressed.
To illustrate, example 2 in \reffig{teaser} would \naive ly produce
  the extraction (Chancelor Merkel of Germany; visit; China);\footnote{
    Actual output from OLLIE.
  }
  however, most downstream applications would strongly prefer the subject
  of the triple to drop the prepositional phrase.
For instance, when applying open IE to a conventional relation extraction
  task, overly fine grained arguments like \ww{Chancelor Merkel of Germany}
  must either be treated as atomic units (leading to recall errors),
  use heuristic matching (potentially leading to harmful extractions
  like \ww{Germany visited China}), or be further parsed by the application
  (which is counterproductive to using open IE in the first place).
  
On the other hand, it's often incorrect to maximally shorten an argument.
For example, \ww{No house cats have rabbies} should not entail that
  \ww{cats have rabbies}, or even that \ww{house cats have rabbies}.
Furthermore, the sentence \ww{enemies give fake compliments} should not
  produce the triple (enemies; give; compliments).

A natural framework for solving this problem is natural logic -- 
  a proof system built on the syntax of human language (see Section XYZ).
We can then observe that
  \ww{Chancelor Merkel of Germany visited China yesterday} entails
  that \ww{Chancelor Merkel visited China yesterday},
  but that \ww{enemies give fake compliments} does not entail that
  \ww{enemies give ocmpliments}.
Furthermore, the framework allows us to capture more subtle phenomena:
  whereas \ww{all rabbits eat fresh vegetables} yields
  (rabbits; eat; vegetables), the apparently similar sentence
  \ww{all young rabbits drink milk} does not yield
  (rabbits; drink; milk).

% Conclude
Combining these two insights, we create an open IE system which
  captures long-range dependencies without requiring a large rule set
  by learning to split long sentences into coherent shorter utterances
  from which triples can be extracted,
  and then exploits natural logic semantics to find the optimal granularity
  for the arguments of those triples.
% Scores
We show that our new system performs well on a real world evaluation --
  the TAC KBP relation extraction competition.
We compare against state-of-the-art open IE systems, and show a
  9000\% absolute F$_1$ improvement over the system.
