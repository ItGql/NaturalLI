Simple lexical methods are often surprisingly effective at
  solving entailment problems.
However, they are easily thrown off by even simple logical
  fallacies -- e.g., negation.
We treat question answering as an entailment task from a large
  premise set, and present an approach combining lexical
  classification with soft logical reasoning.
We validate on the FraCaS test suite for entailment, and present
  the best published results on the Aristo science exams corpus.
