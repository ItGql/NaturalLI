Simple lexical methods are often surprisingly effective at
  solving entailment problems.
However, they are easily thrown off by lexically subtle logical
  fallacies -- e.g., negation.
We present an approach for combining logical reasoning with
  Natural Logic with a broad-coverage but lower-precision
  lexical classifier, and show that this combination outperforms
  either system in isolation.
We evaluate our system in a question answering setting, where
  a large set of candidate premises can confirm or contradict
  the truth of a query.
We validate our system on strict entailments in the FraCaS test suite,
  and present
  the best published results on the Aristo science exams corpus.
