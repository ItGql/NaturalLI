Natural logic question answering system, such as NaturalLI,
  can capture a large number of useful inferences; nonetheless,
  there are many cases that are out of scope for the
  formalism.
We propose two contributions to mitigate these cases:
  we incorporate reasoning about relational entailment
  (e.g., \w{buy} $\rightarrow$ \w{own}) 
  and meronymy
  (e.g., a person born in a city is born the city's country).
Furthermore, while searching for candidate premises, backoff to
  a lexical classifier for a soft judgment on whether
  the candidate is entailed by a known premise.
This allows us to provide a confidence for every query.
%Simple lexical methods are often surprisingly effective at
%  solving entailment problems.
%However, they are easily thrown off by lexically subtle logical
%  fallacies -- e.g., negation.
%We present an approach for combining logical reasoning with
%  Natural Logic with a broad-coverage but lower-precision
%  lexical classifier, and show that this combination outperforms
%  either system in isolation.
%We evaluate our system in a question answering setting, where
%  a large set of candidate premises can confirm or contradict
%  the truth of a query.
We validate that our system maintains strict entailments on FraCaS,
  and present
  the best published results on the Aristo science exams corpus.
