\Section{softsignal}{Soft Signals from Natural Logic}
There are many cases -- particularly as the length premise and the hypothesis grows --
  where even a soft version of NaturalLI will consistently fail to find any supporting
  premises.
Most often, this is because of either long-range rewrites that no longer share a
  dependency structure, or because of idiomatic or otherwise sparse local rewrites.
