  \begin{itemize}
    \item Each transition is a (possibly incorrect) natural logic
          inference step.
    \item These include hypernymy, nearest neighbors, quantifier
          mutations, inserting/deleting words, etc.
    \item Each transition has an associated learned \textit{cost}.
          Analogous to Markov Logic for FOL.
    \item Computation becomes faster, not slower, with larger
          knowledge bases.
  \end{itemize}
