\Section{conclusion}{Conclusion}
We have presented NaturalLI, an inference system over
  unstructured text intended to infer common sense facts.
We have shown that we can run inference over a large set of premises
  while maintaining Natural Logic semantics, and that
  we can learn how to infer unseen common sense facts.

Future work will focus on enriching the class of inferences we can
  make with Natural Logic.
Formally, Natural Logic is able to reason about any partial ordering
  over lexical items -- this paper explores the hypernymy relation
  (subset over denotations), but the same framework elegantly extends
  to meronymy or relational entailment.
Furthermore, we hope to learn richer lexicalized parameters,
  and make use of the syntactic structure of a fact during search.
