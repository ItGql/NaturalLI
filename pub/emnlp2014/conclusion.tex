\Section{conclusion}{Conclusion}
We have presented NaturalLI, an inference system over
  unstructured text intended to infer common sense facts.
We have shown that we can run inference over a large set of premises
  while maintaining Natural Logic semantics, and that
  we can learn how to infer unseen common sense facts.

Future work will focus on enriching the class of inferences we can
  make with Natural Logic.
For example, extending the approach to handle meronymy and
  relation entailments.
Furthermore, we hope to learn richer lexicalized parameters,
  and use the syntactic structure of a fact during search.
