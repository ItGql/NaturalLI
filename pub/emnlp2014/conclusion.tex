\Section{conclusion}{Conclusion}
We have presented NaturalLI, an inference system over
  unstructured text intended to infer common sense facts.
We have shown that we can run inference over a large set of premises
  while maintaining valid Natural Logic semantics, and have shown that
  we can learn how to infer unseen common sense facts.

Future work will focus on enriching the class of inferences we can
  make with Natural Logic -- in particular, reasoning with meronymy
  and relational entailment.
Furthermore, we hope to learn lexicalized parameters,
  and make use of the syntactic structure of a fact during search.
