Common-sense reasoning is important for a range of AI applications,
  partly in NLP but also in semantically motivated vision tasks or
  high level planning for robotics.
Common-sense reasoning if prevalent in a number of AI tasks;
  although such reasoning is difficult in general, we hope to
  capture a subset of useful phenomena.
For instance, in computer vision it may be useful to provide priors
  for cars generally being found on roads, or
  computer mice being next to monitors.
Similarly, for robotics (e.g., for illustration, a robot to help in
  the kitchen) it may be useful to know that milk is found
  in a refrigerator, or that tomatoes are soft and easy to crush.
