Common-sense reasoning is important for a range of AI applications,
  both in NLP but also in semantically motivated vision or robotics tasks.
We propose NaturaLI: a system for inferring factoid style common sense
  facts -- for instance, \textit{cats have tails} or
  \textit{tomatoes are fragile} -- from a large database of candidate
  justifications.
The system provides logically valid derivations, while also being flexible
  to backing off to derivations which are only likely valid, with an
  associated confidence.
We show that our system is able to capture strict Natural Logic 
  inferences on the FraCaS test suite, and demonstrate the 
  system's ability to infer previously unseen facts.
