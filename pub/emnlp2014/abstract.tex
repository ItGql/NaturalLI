Common-sense reasoning is important for a range of AI applications,
  both in NLP and many vision or robotics tasks.
We propose NaturalLI: a Natural Logic inference system for inferring
  common sense facts -- for instance, \textit{cats have tails} or
  \textit{tomatoes are fragile} --
  from a very large database of known facts.
The system provides logically valid derivations, while also being flexible
  to backing off to derivations which are only likely valid,
  accompanied by an associated confidence.
We show that our system is able to capture strict Natural Logic 
  inferences on the FraCaS test suite, and demonstrate the 
  system's ability to infer previously unseen facts with 50\%
  recall and 91\% precision.
