Common-sense reasoning is important for AI applications,
  both in NLP and many vision and robotics tasks.
We propose \mbox{NaturalLI}: a Natural Logic inference system for 
  inferring
  common sense facts -- for instance, that \textit{cats have tails} or
  \textit{tomatoes are fragile} --
  from a very large database of known facts.
In addition to providing strictly valid derivations, the system is
  also able to produce derivations which are only likely valid,
  accompanied by an associated confidence.
We show that our system is able to capture strict Natural Logic 
  inferences on the FraCaS test suite, and demonstrate its
  ability to infer previously unseen facts with 48\%
  recall and 93\% precision.
