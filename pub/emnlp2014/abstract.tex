Common-sense reasoning is important for a range of AI applications,
  partly in NLP but also in semantically motivated vision tasks or
  high level planning for robotics.
We propose NaturaLI: a system for inferring factoid style common sense
  facts -- for instance, \textit{cats have tails} or
  \textit{tomatoes are fragile}.
The system provides support for a query in a large database of candidate
  antecedents, preferring logically valid derivations but gracefully
  backing off to derivations which are only likely valid, with an
  associated confidence.
We show that our system is able to capture strict Natural Logic on the
  FraCaS test suite, and demonstrate the system's ability to infer
  previously unseen facts.
