The high-level goal of this work is to provide a means of inferring
  truth from a large set of candidate common-sense antecedents,
  preferring logically
  valid inferences where available, but importantly backing off
  gracefully to dubious inferences with an associated informative
  confidence of validity.

Prior work has largely focused on factoid-type knowledge base entries:
  for instance, \textit{Barack Obama is married to Michelle}, or
  \textit{Natasha is the daughter of Michelle Obama}.
In this framework, inference tasks are generally cast as expanding
  a partial knowledge base with additional high-probability facts
  (e.g., Knowledge Base Population).
While this approach is viable for these sorts of factoid entries,
  the number of common-sense facts -- the vast majority of which are
  never explicitly mentioned -- is unlikely to be amenable to this
  strategy.

We therefore re-cast the problem as querying whether an arbitrary fact
  is true or not, given the entire knowledge base as the
  antecedent set.
We then approach the problem as finding a correct reverse derivation
  from the consequent to any antecedent in our knowledge base.

When possible, these derivations should be valid Natural Logic derivations;
  however, the search is robust to proposing plausible, if not
  strictly correct, inferences at a discount proportional to the
  likelihood of validity.
For instance, our approach generalizes similarity metrics, suggesting
  that if two entities are similar to each other (e.g., cats and dogs)
  then they are likely to share properties (e.g., have tails).
This discount on incorrect inferences can be set to enforce strict
  validity, but can as easily be trained on a dataset of facts labeled
  with their truth, to calibrate the resulting probability returned
  from the system.

We evaluate the system on the FraCaS entailment suite to motivate its
  validity as an inference engine, and evaluate in a more realistic
  setting of filtering implausible extractions from ReVerb.
