\Section{conclude}{Conclusion}
We have presented two theoretical improvements to natural logic inference to
  make the formalism more robust for question answering.
We augment the formalism with a theory for handling relational entailment and meronymy,
  and we incorporate a soft evaluation function for predicting likely entailments when
  formal support could not be found.
These features allow us to perform large-scale broad domain question answering,
  achieving the best published numbers on the Aristo science exams corpus.
