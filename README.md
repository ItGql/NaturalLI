NaturalLI
===========
**Natural [Language|Logic] Inference**

NaturalLI is a Natural Logic reasoning engine aimed at fast inference
from a large database of known facts.
The project's primary goal is to infer whether arbitrary common-sense
facts are true, given a large database of known facts.
The system is described in:

    Gabor Angeli and Christopher D. Manning. "NaturalLI: Natural Logic for Common Sense Reasoning." EMNLP 2014.


On Ubuntu, the program can be built (including all dependencies) with:

    ./install_deps.sh
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
