Half-baked components:
  - update quantifier polarity during search.
  - think through all the quantifier monotonicities.
  - FraCaS had some dependency tweaks that I was supposed to implement
  - Add triggers for meronymy

  * update C++ code with collapsed dependencies
  * incorporate new graph from Neha
  * add meronymy; relation entailment.
  * fix dependency parses (e.g., negation, punctuation).
  * incorporate prepositions in forward entailment.


Additional types of mutations:
  * Passivisation (the cat ate the mouse -> the mouse was eaten by the cat)
  * CC dominance (the zebra is black and white -> the zebra is white and black)
