Half-baked components:
  - fix dependency parses (e.g., negation, punctuation).
  - update quantifier polarity during search.
  - add meronymy; relation entailment.
  - think through all the quantifier monotonicities.
  - update C++ code with collapsed dependencies
  - FraCaS had some dependency tweaks that I was supposed to implement
  * prepositions in forward entailment.


Additional types of mutations:
  * Passivisation (the cat ate the mouse -> the mouse was eaten by the cat)
  * CC dominance (the zebra is black and white -> the zebra is white and black)
